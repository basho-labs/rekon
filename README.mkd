#Rekon

A visual browser for Basho's data store, riak, built as a riak app.

This browser uses list buckets and list keys; operations that are known to
be expensive on any bucket with any sufficient number of keys.  As such; this tool is intended for use within ***local (application development)*** environments only.

Rekon should ***NOT*** be used on a production cluster ***EVER***.

For something that can used against a production cluster, please see [Riak Control](https://github.com/basho/riak_control).

## Installing

### tl;dr
`curl -s rekon.basho.com | sh`

### Quick Install
Download and install using `curl -s rekon.basho.com | sh` or 
`curl -s rekon.basho.com | node=node-addr:port sh` to specify the node.

### Manual Install
Install locally using `./install.sh` or `./install.sh node-addr:port` 
to specify the node.

## Usage

Once installed navigate to http://node-addr:port/buckets/rekon/keys/go.

If you have installed riak on the standard port this will be [http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/rekon/keys/go](http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/rekon/keys/go).

## Known Issues
 * Editing a riak value does not retain 2i index information.
 * Lots of list buckets, lots of list keys.
